In a production environment, directly reloading the FastAPI app or server whenever the pickle file is updated is not a recommended approach. Reloading the app during runtime could lead to downtime and disruption of the service for users. Instead, you can follow a more seamless and safe approach by using an external mechanism to trigger the update process.

Here's a high-level outline of how you can handle the pickle file update in a production environment:

1. Set up a Webhook or a Background Service:
   Implement a webhook in your PHP CodeIgniter 3 application or set up a background service that monitors the database updates. When the main app's database is updated, this webhook or service will trigger a notification to the FastAPI application.

2. Update Notification:
   Upon receiving the notification from the webhook or background service, the FastAPI app should be designed to handle the update process without interrupting the service. This could involve updating the data in memory (e.g., movie_data) and/or updating the pickle file.

3. Separate Data Loading Function:
   Instead of loading the pickle file during app startup, create a separate function to load the pickle file and update the data in memory. This function can be called upon receiving the notification. You can also call this function periodically as a background task to update the data at specific intervals.

4. Avoiding Server Restart:
   The key here is to avoid restarting the entire FastAPI server just to update the pickle file. Instead, handle the data update within the running FastAPI app without interruption. In a production environment, you should use a production-ready server like Gunicorn or Uvicorn in combination with a process manager like Supervisor or Systemd. This allows you to gracefully manage app updates and ensure that the service remains available during the update process.

Here's a simplified example of how you could structure your FastAPI app to handle the data update without restarting the server:

```python
import pickle
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

movie_data = None

def load_movie_data():
    global movie_data
    with open('movies_listt.pkl', 'rb') as f:
        movie_data = pickle.load(f)

# Load the movie_data during app startup
load_movie_data()

@app.get('/recommend')
async def get_movie_recommendation(movie: str):
    # Use the 'movie_data' to generate recommendations
    # ...

@app.get('/update_movie_data')
async def update_movie_data():
    # Triggered by a webhook or background service
    # Reload the pickle file and update 'movie_data'
    load_movie_data()
    return {"message": "Movie data updated successfully."}
```

In this example, the `load_movie_data()` function is responsible for loading the pickle file and updating the `movie_data` in memory. You can call this function in response to the `/update_movie_data` endpoint, which is triggered by the webhook or background service. Additionally, you can schedule periodic updates by calling `load_movie_data()` in a background task.

Remember that the example above is simplified, and in a production environment, you'll need to ensure proper handling of concurrent requests, implement appropriate error handling, and use a production-ready server and process manager to manage the FastAPI app efficiently.
